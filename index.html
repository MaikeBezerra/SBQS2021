		<p class="text-justify">
      [Context] Self-adaptive systems (SAS) can evaluate their own behavior at 
      runtime and change it when necessary to avoid failures. Many of those 
      systems require a high processing power to carry out their dynamic and 
      complex operations successfully. In this realm, performance arises as an 
      important quality attribute that has been widely used in the literature 
      to drive the necessary adaptation strategies in SAS to achieve or maintain 
      the QoS requirements. However, few studies evaluate the performance of SAS 
      efficiently due to the lack of knowledge on all possible performance 
      measures, since commonly only a reduced number of them is used in each 
      study. Still, there are a variety of measures scattered throughout the 
      body of work in this area. 
      [Objective] Our objective is to create a catalog of performance measures 
      for assessing self-adaptive systems. 
      [Method] To do that, we identified and analyzed the performance measures 
      used in 32 primary studies found through a literature review. 
      [Results] As a result, 18 measures have been inserted in the catalog, 
      having most of them addressed the sub-characteristics of time-behavior 
      and the resource utilization. To validate the catalog, a subset of 
      measures was implemented in a self-adaptive healthcare system.

		<!-- <h3 id="qualitymetrics" class="page-header">Coupling Metrics</h3>
		<p class="text-justify">

           Coupling measures how much a SPL component provides functionalities to other components, or depends on functionalities provided by other components. That is, coupling metrics aim at capturing when SPL components are strongly attached to the whole SPL. Thus, a high coupling suggests that the SPL components are strongly attached to other components and, therefore play an essential role in the operation of the product line. On the other hand, a low coupling suggests that the SPL component is not essential to operate the product line. In order to characterize critical components in component-based SPL, we used the following conventional coupling metrics. The first column presents the name of each metric. The second column describes the metric.

		<h3 id="detectionstrategy" class="page-header">Detection Strategy</h3>
		<p class="text-justify">
			The figure below presents our metric-based strategy for characterizing critical components. A detection strategy combines multiples metrics to characterize components that satisfy a property, the component criticality in our case. We assume that both FANIN and CBO explicitly capture coupling between critical components. Based on the literature of component-based SPL, a critical component is the one that has too many dependencies with other components, which we can measure with CBO > Threshold and FANIN > Threshold. However, from our viewpoint, FANOUT > Threshold may not suffice to characterize critical components because, considering the SPL architecture, each component tend to use features provided by several other components. However, when a component is deeply located in the inheritance tree and has too many children components, such external dependencies indicated by FANOUT > Threshold may negatively impact on the SPL product configuration, which makes the critical components. Thus, FANOUT has to be combined with DIT > Threshold and NOC > Threshold for capturing critical components.
